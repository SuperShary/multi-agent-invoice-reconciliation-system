Matched to PO-2024-004 via exact po reference (98% confidence). Detected 2 discrepancies:   - Price Mismatch: Line item 'Ibuprofen BP 200mg': Invoice unit price \u00a388.00 vs PO price \u00a380.00 (10.0% increase)   - Total Variance: Invoice total \u00a313476.00 vs PO total \u00a313176.00 (variance: \u00a3300.00, 2.3%) Risk factors: 1 high-severity discrepancies, 1 medium-severity discrepancies. RECOMMENDATION: ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN. Significant issues detected. Immediate human attention required before processing. Human Reviewer: Data extraction quality is high. However, the core reconciliation failed due to a critical price variance on item GPS-A101 (Ibuprofen BP 200mg). The invoice unit price of \u00a388.00 is 10% higher than the PO price of \u00a380.00. This variance must be resolved with the procurement team or the supplier (via a confirmed price change or a credit note) before payment can be processed. The current recommendation to escalate is appropriate and mandatory."
